spänkmoog
=========

Project work for a "signaalinprosessorit ja äänenkäsittely" (spänk) course, or
signal processors and audio processing. This is a virtual analog synth, for a
Chameleon_ DSP thing. Written in DSP56303 assembly. Also included a sequencer
for MCF5206e, in C.

Academic code. Not optimized for speed but clarity and modularity. Should be
modified for at least to work in small buffers instead of one sample at a time.
The DSP development environment for this machine is horrible, though.
